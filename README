This is a fairly basic, rather bad [MediaWiki](https://mediawiki.org) extension.

It adds a new ``{{CURRENTLANG}}`` magic word, which will show as the ISO 639
language code that the user currently has their interface language set to.

To install, extract into your ``extensions`` directory and add the following
near the bottom of ``LocalSettings.php``:

```php
require_once "$IP/extensions/LanguageCodeMagicWord/LanguageCodeMagicWord.php";
```
